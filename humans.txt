Hi hooman,

This is the backstory. Why do you care? You probably don't.
I'm all out of eggs, and it's xmasâ€¦

I spend a lot of time on this. I know it doesn't look like much.
However, the main consideration was loading speed.
I wanted to make the page load as fast as possible,
to the point where it would be fast on a 56k modem.
That's important because Google likes data. They don't like time spent getting it.
Fast and light is easy and cheap to index,
users are more likely to be satisfied, so it should rank higher.

The speed of light is a constant. The number of times a website can be visited
by a unique client is directly linked to the speed at which it can be downloaded.
The only way to make that faster is by reducing size.
Then the client needs to render the page.
So it should be as simple as possible to reduce time spent on computation.
That's why there is no javascript, and also why
one of the first rules of the css file unsets everything.
It should be accessible. That has always been a major concern of mine.

The html code HAD to be valid. It doesn't need to be, but I bothered to read the standard,
so I know what I can and cannot omit, and where.

For example: no head tag. Why waste 13 bytes?
